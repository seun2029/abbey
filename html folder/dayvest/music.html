<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae" title="the best place to know more about reggae music" target="_blank">reggae music</a> </h1>

<p>reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora</p>

<p>A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, "Do the Reggay" was the first popular song to use the word "reggae", effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.</p>

<p>While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady</p>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music" title="the best place to know more about country music" target="_blank">country music</a> </h2>

<p>Country (also called country and western) is a genre of popular music that originated with blues, church music such as Southern gospel and spirituals, old-time, and American folk music forms including Appalachian, Cajun, Creole, and the cowboy Western music styles of New Mexico, Red Dirt, Tejano, and Texas country. Its popularized roots originate in the Southern and Southwestern United States of the early 1920s.
    
    <p>Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes (most commonly known as "Honky Tonk music") with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies often accompanied by string instruments such as electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), banjos, and fiddles as well as harmonicas.[1][2][3] Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history.</p>

    <p>The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009, in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute</p>

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrobeat" title="the best place to know more about afrobeat music" target="_blank">afrobeat music</a> </h3>
    
    <p>Afrobeat is a music genre that involves the combination of West African musical styles (such as traditional Yoruba music and highlife) and American jazz, funk, and soul influences,[1] with a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion.[2] The style was pioneered in the 1970s by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti, who is responsible for popularizing the style both within and outside Nigeria.</p>

    <p>Afrobeat is also influenced by Highlife, which began in Ghana in the early 1920s. During that time, Ghanaian musicians incorporated foreign influences like the foxtrot and calypso with Ghanaian rhythms such as osibisaba (Fante). Yoruba vocal traditions, rhythm, and instruments are incorporated. Highlife was associated with the local African aristocracy during the colonial period and was played by numerous bands including the Jazz Kings, Cape Coast Sugar Babies, and Accra Orchestra along the country's coast. This was the music Fela Kuti and Tony Allen played and listened to when they were young.</p>

    <p>In the late 1950s, Kuti left Lagos to study abroad at the London School of Music where he was exposed to jazz. He returned to Lagos and played a highlife-jazz hybrid, albeit, without commercial success</p>
